                        <h1> Command, CMD </h1>
                        <p>CMD is a networking website that I gave my modern and artistic take on. Using gradients and effective use of dark space, I was able to design, using AdobeXD, the home & login pages for both desktop and mobile use. This is one of my first projects in AdobeXD, after years of experience in photoshop, this is how I learned the basics of XD- for learning the basics, I think I did pretty damn well.</p>

                        <h1> ParkMark </h1>
                        <p>ParkMark is a solo project that I, myself, curated UI/UX for entirely. This is an interactive map app who's target audience is skaters, just like me. This map app allows skaters to interact with eachother and create virtual skateparks around the world using geolocation tags. This is not an implemented app as of yet, but I have plans to do such.</p>

                        <p>We Are Cursed, A.K.A- WERCRSED, is a clothing brand webstore that wanted a clean and simple aesthetic that targeted vintage styles that are marketed toward the college adult audience. I took inspiration from artwork curated for and by Frank Ocean.</p>
